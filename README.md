**Bank Back** is a simplified banking system built with **Java** and **Spring Boot**.   It implements different account types (`Checking`, `StudentChecking`, `Savings`, `CreditCard`) and user roles (`Admin`, `AccountHolder`, `ThirdParty`), following OOP best practices with **JPA inheritance** and a **MySQL database**.
